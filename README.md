## Notification Framework Example With Mongo

Documentation on how to make the notification framework up and running with nodejs project

### Project structure

The example repository follows mono-repo architecture where frontend(FE), backend(BE) and all other directories are stored as a single codebase.

### FE - Front end

NextJs project. Can be anything depending on project requirements. 

### CommonTs

A shared folder between backend and frontend. This is optional. We use this to reduce code duplication between frontend and backend.

### BE - Back end

NodeJS project. This is where our notification framework will live. 

### Installing dependencies

Run ```npm install``` in both FE and BE.

### Clone the notification framework

Clone the notification framework in using 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jhotika/notification-framework.git
```
